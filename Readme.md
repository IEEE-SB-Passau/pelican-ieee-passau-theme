This is the pelican template for the website of the IEEE Student Branch Passau (ieee.uni-passau.de).

Necessary plugins are: 
* events
* i18n_subsites
* tipuesearch
* sitemap
* photos

Setting up pelican is easy and should be done in a virtualenv environment (c.f docs.getpelican.com/en/3.6.3/install.html).

After setting the environment up you need to install additional python packages in order to make some of the plugins work:
* beautifulsoup4
* icalendar
* pillow
